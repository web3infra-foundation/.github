# Web3 Infrastructure Foundation

Web3 Infrastructure Foundation is an open-source software foundation for Web3 infrastructure based in Hong Kong. It is a non-profit organization whose goal is to promote the development of open-source Web3 infrastructure by bringing together high-quality open-source projects from around the world and establishing a presence in Hong Kong.

## Background

Web3 is the next-generation Internet technology based on decentralized technology, and its cross-border and cross-organizational nature is a perfect match for Hong Kong's status as a free port. The rapid development of the Web3 industry must be based on solid computer system technology. Against this backdrop, a group of technology enthusiasts decided to establish the Web3 Infrastructure Foundation after a long period of preparation.

## Mission and Visition

Web3 Infrastructure Foundation is committed to building a decentralized technology ecosystem, covering a wide range of fields such as consensus algorithms (PoW/PoS), federation, zero-knowledge proof (SNARKs and ring signatures), Relay Based Protocol, DID (decentralized identity authentication), trusted computing, confidential computing, operating system runtime security, software and firmware/hardware supply chain security, distributed ledger technology(blockchain), and more. The Foundation strives to create an open, transparent, and high-quality technology ecosystem that provides a reliable and robust operational infrastructure for the global Web3 community.The Foundation hopes that individuals or groups interested in Web3 infrastructure-related technologies will actively participate and join the Web3 Infrastructure Foundation.
